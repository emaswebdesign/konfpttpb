      <h4>Welcome</h4>
      <p>
        We are pleased to once again invite you to participate in the “Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy. Beyond
        Individual
        Psychotherapy” international scientific conference, hosted by the prof. Zdzisław Bizoń Polish Association of
        Cognitive
        and Behavioral Therapy. The conference will take place online on April 2-4 2021. Though we were hoping to meet
        you in
        person, the current circumstances have forced us to move online.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the conference, you will have opportunities to learn about the latest findings from cognitive-behavioral
        psychotherapy research and practice in many areas of application: individual, group, as well as family and
        couples’
        therapy. Such a wide perspective is particularly innovative considering that in Poland, cognitive-behavioral
        psychotherapy is usually associated with individual therapy. During their workshops and plenary lectures, expert
        guests
        both from Poland and abroad will present the theory and practice of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy on a
        world-class
        level. Presentations by Polish researchers and practitioners will serve as an opportunity to share knowledge on
        the
        growth and development of cognitive-behavioral psychoterapy in our country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conference will include lectures, workshops, supervision sessions, symposia, and poster sessions. The
        conference
        program has remained largely unchanged. It will soon be published on the conference website.
      </p>
      <p>Participation in the conference will be counted towards teaching hours <i>(godziny dydaktyczne)</i> required
        for renewing the
        PTTPB Psychotherapist and Supervisor-Teacher Certificate.</p>
