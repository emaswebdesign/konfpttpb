      <p>ProfessorAndrzej Kucmierczyk - son of Polish postwar immigrants, born and grew up in Highgate, north London. He
        graduated in psychology and sociology at the University of Keele and began a three-year practice at the
        Cognitive-Behavioural clinic at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School under Professor Victor Meyer. In 1980, he
        began
        his PhD studies in clinical psychology at the University of Georgia and the University of California Los Angeles
        (UCLA).
        After his PhD studies, he taught psychiatry in New York and New Orleans medical schools until 1994, where he
        also served
        as the director of behavioural medicine sections. After returning to England in 1994, he became the chairman of
        the
        postgraduate studies in health psychology at the University of London. In 2013 he became Professor of Clinical
        Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire and he leads a private pain clinic. </p>
      <p>
        Alongside numerous publications on the topic of psychosomatics, Professor Kucmierczyk is also the co-author of
        one of
        the first texts in health psychology, “Health Psychology - A Psychobiological Perspective” (1986). Next, he
        released
        “Formulation and Treatment in Health Psychology,” which concerned the psychological formulation and treatment in
        physiological illnesses. Professor Kucmierczyk is particularly interested in researching and treating the
        biopsychosocial mechanisms in chronic pain, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and generalized anxiety
        disorder.</p>

        Aside from his academic work, Professor Kucmierczyk is passionate about poetry, as well as rock, blues, and jazz
        music.
        Throughout his professional career, he has written poetry, initially inspired by his Mother - author and poet of
        the
        Warsaw Uprising. Existential philosophy, particularly Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, served as a subsequent
        influence on his poetical development. His first book of poetry, “Transitions of Love, Hope, and Faith,” was
        released in
        2009, and his second - “Bezpośrednio -Na Żywo” in 2016. His third book of poetry, “Między Piachem a Niebem” will
        be
        released in 2022. Professor Kucmierczyk’s poems concern relationships, doubt, personal calling, conflicts, love,
        and
        socio-political satire.
